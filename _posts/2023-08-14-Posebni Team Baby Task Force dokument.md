>The ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) clinical management guidelines have concluded, “use of progestins for threatened early pregnancy loss is controversial, and conclusive evidence supporting their use is lacking. Women who have experienced at least three prior pregnancy losses, however, may benefit from progesterone therapy in the first trimester"

Pitanje serumske razine progesterona:
>Historically, there have been tests that evaluate whether women have a luteal phase deficiency. However, this is hard to measure accurately. Blood levels of progesterone may vary throughout the day, and progesterone levels seen within the uterus itself may not correlate with progesterone levels observed in the blood. Therefore, some doctors supplement women attempting to achieve pregnancy with progesterone in many cases of infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss, even if tests are normal.

### Early pregnancy maternal progesterone administration alters pituitary and testis function and steroid profile in male fetuses[^2]

>Epidemiological evidence based on male neonatal examination suggests that progesterone supplementation in women in early pregnancy is safe. There does not seem to be an increase in congenital abnormalities in male offspring born to women after progesterone supplementation. Hypospadias was associated with maternal progesterone supplementation in cohort studies OR 3.7 (CI 2.3–6.0)<sup>49</sup> when synthetic progestogen was generally used. However, an increased risk of hypospadias was not seen in the recent clinical trials using natural progesterone supplementation in recurrent miscarriage<sup>50</sup> and threatened miscarriage<sup>18</sup>. Exposure of pregnant mice to pharmacological doses of progesterone reduced circulating testosterone levels, but does not cause abnormalities of male internal and external genitalia<sup>51</sup>. It is therefore likely that congenital abnormalities, which can be detected at birth, are rare after progesterone supplementation in early pregnancy and not a consequence of any effect of progesterone on the developing male reproductive system.

Nema dokaza o kongenitalnim nedostacima. Ipak, studija na miševima upućuje na potencijal progesterona za ometanje razvitka muških obrazaca ponašanja u odrasloj dobi:
>There is a lack of data on whether there are any longer-term functional effects of increased prenatal exposure to progesterone either on the testis or the brain in offspring and into adulthood. There are no data on the testis or pituitary and only limited data on potential brain effects in the longer term. In mice prenatal progesterone supplementation interferes with masculine behaviour in adulthood, likely due to diminished peripheral testosterone levels during the prenatal period<sup>52</sup>.

Naposljetku zaključak:
>Overall, we provide evidence that elevating progesterone in early pregnancy has acute contemporaneous effects on the developing pituitary and testes in the male fetus. We cannot say this has postnatal consequences but it is biologically plausible that it could. Tis means that longer term studies on male offspring exposed to increased prenatal progesterone are indicated. In IVF there is no evidence of clinical efficacy for prolonged progesterone support during pregnancy in cycles with ovarian luteal tissue<sup>16</sup>. In addition, there is no evidence that progesterone supplementation should be used to prevent miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage<sup>50</sup> without bleeding or in women with bleeding in early pregnancy without previous miscarriage<sup>18</sup>. We should be wary of prescribing progesterone supplementation in early pregnancy outside the current evidence base in the absence of longer-term safety assessments.

### Effects of Neonatal Exposure to Progesterone on Sexual Behavior of Male and Female Rats[^3]
>Lactating females received daily injections of progesterone or oil, and their offspring were gonadectomized in adulthood and tested for both musculine and feminine sexual behavior elicited by estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone regimens. Male offspring of progesterone treated females exhibited significant impairment of masculine behavior elicited by both estrogen and testosterone. Latency and frequency of mounts and intromissions of those males which did engage in sexual behavior were not significantly different for the two groups. There were nonsignificant trends toward demasculinization of progesterone treated females and feminization of progesterone treated males. Progesterone administered to estrogen primed males failed to facilitate lordosis. There were no progesterone related differences in body weight at any time nor in testis or accessory organ weights of males. The results of this experiment confirm our previous finding of reduced sexual competence of intact male rats exposed neonatally to moderately increased levels of progesterone, and indicate that this effect is not the result of diminished adult hormone levels. Neonatal exposure to progesterone appears to have minimal or no effect on feminine sexual behavior of rats.

### Effect of natural progesterone treatment during pregnancy on fetal testosterone and sexual behavior of the male offspring in the mouse[^4]
>The effect of maternal exposure to progesterone upon the fetal pituitary-gonadal axis and the sexual behavior of the male offspring of mice were studied. Daily injection of progesterone from days 14 to 16 of pregnancy reduced testosterone production in the fetus but caused a significant increase in circulating LH levels. Progesterone-exposed males showed no alteration in anogenital distance or in body weight at any time from birth to adulthood. At 80-90 days of age males from control and progesterone-exposed groups did not differ from each other in testis and seminal vesicle weights. However, in the latter group, there was a marked reduction in the percentage of males that displayed mount, intromission and ejaculation patterns. These findings indicate that in utero exposure to pharmacological doses of progesterone that do not cause abnormalities of male internal and external genitalia may interfere with masculine behavior in adulthood. This alteration could partially be due to diminished peripheral testosterone levels during the prenatal period.
